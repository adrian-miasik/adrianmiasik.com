<h2><a href="https://deploy-preview-6--adrianmiasik.netlify.com/">Browser Report: Examining the Bones Update</a></h2>
<h3>Author: Adrian Miasik</h3>
<h3>Publication Date: 2019-11-05 (10:38 p.m. EST)</h3>
<p>
    There's a lot I want to talk about on here:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I want to talk preview deploys and how I'm hosting this website. (p.s. It's just <a
            href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>)
    </li>
    <li>I want to talk about ASCII, Unicode, and UTF-8.</li>
    <li>I want to stylize this website using CSS.</li>
    <li>I want to create some sort of database for these blog entries.</li>
    <li>I want to create a better landing page for my website.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    There's a lot of "<i>I want</i>"s in there. Today I won't be covering any of that just yet. Instead I wanted
    to do another "browser status report" to see how
    browsers parses this site after <span style="color: gray">&#129460 The Bones Update &#129460</span> and try to solve
    and obvious browser errors we see.
    And I also need to address a mistake I've made in my 2nd post.
    (Post #4 and we are already addressing a mistake?) Let's get into it!
    <br>
    <br>
    First up is Firefox.
    <br>
</p>
So last time Firefox gave us this error:
<blockquote style="color: red">
    The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some
    browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding
    of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
</blockquote>
And this time Firefox is giving us this error:
<blockquote style="color: red">
    The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some
    browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding
    of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
</blockquote>
So what gives? We are getting the same error. You said defining the DOCTYPE by placing <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE
    html&gt;</code>
at the top of the html file will resolve this error.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nope. I was wrong.</strong>
<br>
<br>
I realized that defining the document type is not the same as defining the character encoding.<br>
<br>
Also I realized I never explained what defining the document type was...So here goes!
<br>
<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> solves the document type warnings and lets the browser know
that it will be reading this as an HTML document. Defining the document type is often referred to as <i>DTD
    declaration</i>.
(Document Type Definition). So why do we have to do this DTD declaration?
Well, believe it or not but there are different types of HTML. And most browsers don't know which one you are using.
The browser will actually try to "doctype sniff" and guess the document type you are using if one is not provided.
But since programmers love being explicit, just define it. Just remember that there is one declaration that almost
everyone uses,
<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. Everything else is pretty much just a legacy thing.
<br>
<br>
But how do we define the character encoding? And what is character encoding?
<br>
<br>
Great questions. I did a bunch of research on this since I was curious about this too. In fact, I'll be sharing my
findings in another post.<br>
But for the scope of this post, I'm not going to go into that rabbit hole right now.
If you are interested in hearing a brief explanation of character encoding, ASCII, Unicode, and UTF-8. <a
        href="https://github.com/adrian-miasik/adrianmiasik.com/releases"> Make sure to
    watch my GitHub releases page.</a> ;)
<br>
<br>
Okay sure, I'll ignore what character encoding is for now. How do I solve this character encoding error?
<br>
<br>
There are actually many solutions to this answer. But...for a lot of modern web pages you are probably going to resort
to
character encoding UTF-8. (especially for western characters)
<br>
For now we can solve this error by
adding this to our HTML head: <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>
<br>
<br>
Second up is Google Chrome.
<br>
Works just fine!
<br>
<br>
Next up is Internet Explorer 11.
<br>
Loads fine. However I did realize, the emotes in my previous post title "The Bones Update" are not being displayed
properly.
Instead of bones, there are blue hollow boxes. And the emotes within the post look different and only have a black and
white color scheme.
Interesting observation. Besides that, everything looks fine.
<br>
<br>
Last up is Microsoft Edge.
<br>
Microsoft Edge, renders everything just fine. However we do have 6 console messages. (1 info, 5 warnings)
Let's go through them:
<br>
<br>
<code>
    HTML1300: Navigation occurred.
</code>
<br>
This is that same simple information log, I'm going to ignore this again.
<br>
<br>
<code>
    HTML1402: Character reference is missing an ending semicolon ";".
</code>
<br>
This is the warning that gets printed 5 times. Apparently I've been creating emoji's in HTML incorrectly.
For instance I've originally created the eyes emoji by typing in <span style="color: red">& # 1 2 9 4 6 0</span> in
HTML.
(with no spaces)
After a quick google search of the error it seems any special character in HTML must end in a semicolon.
<br>
<br>
Alright, that's all 4 browsers I'll be using for this browser report.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Looks like we now have our action items:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Add <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code> to the first thing in our HTML head</li>
    <li>Add a semicolon for any special character in HTML</li>
</ul>
See you in the next update!

    Bam! This update brings us HTML. Everything you see on this page is structured in these two legendary elements:
    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code><code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
    Using HTML gives us access to so many great tools. <strong>We can make font bold. </strong><i>We can italicize
    this shit too.</i><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">WE CAN CENSOR THINGS...kind of</span> I can make
    things
    <a href="">clickable.</a> See that list at the top? That shit's also done in HTML too.

    <br>
    Not sure how I'm going to be
    hosting different versions of the site just yet. But keep an eye out on the "Site Archive" section.
    <br>
    Anyways, till next time! Doot &#127930 Doot &#127930

<p>
    I noticed something in the previous post. I've tested this file on numerous web browsers and each one reacts
    slightly differently. Let me show you.
    <br>
    <br>
    First up is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>.
    <br>
    This file (`index.html`) works on Firefox. But I noticed that the console did spit out an error:
    <br>
<blockquote>The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared.
    The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters
    from
    outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the
    transfer
    protocol.
</blockquote>
Alright that should be pretty easy to address. I've used <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to
learn
web dev before, so I do
remember that
each website needs to adhere to a certain HTML
structure. The first HTML element in any document should be...:<!DOCTYPE html>
<br>
<br>
Hmm, interesting. You didn't see it but adding `!DOCTYPE html` (Replace the ` with <> respectively) doesn't appear
in my versions of Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, and also Microsoft Edge. So even just typing out the
correct
DOCTYPE element in an HTML file is not enough, it does seems to get deleted by
the 4 aforementioned browsers. Good to know. Anyways, I digress.
<br>
<br>
Second up is <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>.
<br>
This file works in Chrome. The console spits out no errors or warnings and accepts this page as is. Great!
<br>
<br>
Third up is <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads">Internet Explorer
    11</a>.
<br>
This file works in Internet Explorer 11. The console spits out no errors or warnings and accepts this page as is.
Also great!
<br>
<br>
Last up is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge">Microsoft Edge</a>.
<br>
This file works in Microsoft Edge but we do get certain console logs. Let's go all 4 of them:
<br>
<br>
<code>
    HTML1300: Navigation occurred.
</code>
<br>
This is a simple information log, I'm going to ignore this one for now.
<br>
<br>
<code>
    HTML1527: DOCTYPE expected. Consider adding a valid HTML5 doctype: "<!DOCTYPE html>".
</code>
<br>
Funny enough, this warning gets removed just like in my Firefox comment before.
<br>
<br>
<code>
    HTML1502: Unexpected DOCTYPE. Only one DOCTYPE is allowed and it must occur before any elements.
</code>
<br>
Okay similar error that I will fix in the next post.
<br>
<br>
<code>
    HTML1407: Invalid tag name. First character should match [a-zA-Z].
</code>
<br>
Okay right so it's complaining about `-` being the first character in this file.
We are replacing the first line with the DOCTYPE so we should first apply that solution and see how Microsoft Edge
reacts.
Funny enough, the copy paste of error 3/4 above is now showing 2 HTML1502 logs on this page.
<br>
<br>
Alright so what have we noticed?
Out of my sample size of 4 browsers, all of them were able to view this file just fine.
In fact all four browsers auto-generated a proper HTML structure while putting all the text you are reading into one
paragraph element. Neat-o! Firefox was able to tell us our file was incorrect and how it could be incorrect in some
browsers. Which is really great to see actually! Microsoft Edge was expecting a DOCTYPE but didn't tell us why nor
how. It did however provide us a solution to fix it though. Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 11 had no problems
with our files. Now I'm not sure if that concerns me or not. Haha.
<br>
<br>
<strong>TL;DR:</strong>
<br>
So, what's the takeaway from all this?
Welp, this tells us that most browsers are not the same.
For better or for worse each browser will most likely parse each website slightly differently.
(I'm not going to get to far into that, but this does become a headache later on)<br>
My next steps are clear.
Let's structure this file using HTML.
See you in the next update!

    Alright Chris. I finally made that website I was talking about. It's not much, but it's a start :)
    <br>
    <br>
    In fact I'm not even sure this will properly work on most web browsers. There isn't any proper meta data or html
    tags here. But that's the beauty of this. I get to find out and learn as I go!
    <br>
    So these words you are reading right now are being written inside a program called notepad++.
    Right as I'm done typing this sentence I'm going to save this file as `index.html` and then I'm going to drag
    and
    drop this file into my web browser. Yup, confirmed that it worked. (Which should be fairly obvious to you since
    you
    are reading these words in your web
    browser right now)
    <br>
    So what is this place?
    <br>
    <br>
    Well...Hi. I'm Adrian. I'm the dude writing these words you are reading right now. Yup. that's me. (btw I'm glad
    that's the voice you chose for me)
    Anyways, I've done some web development in my career and spare time but I'm still really new to it.
    In fact I wanted to get back into web dev and also had an itch to create my own website.
    Currently my domain <a href="https://www.adrianmiasik.com">https://www.adrianmiasik.com</a> re-directs to
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a
            third-party website with my game content on it.</span> the most recent version of this website!
    I've been meaning to create a proper place for my domain. So I'll be creating a website that I can use for
    my portfolio work and also a site that I can document this journey on.
    <br>
    I want to create a visual timeline for the history of this site as I create it over time. I'm not sure how far
    I'll
    explore that idea but we'll see!
    <br>
    <br>
    Check back soon!!!! In the meantime check out my website :^) <a href="https://www.adrianmiasik.com">https://www.adrianmiasik.com</a>
