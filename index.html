Alright Chris. I finally made that website I was talking about.

It's not much, but it's a start :)

In fact I'm not even sure this will properly work on most web browsers. There isn't any proper meta data or html tags here.
But that's the beauty of this. I get to find out and learn as I go!

So these words you are reading right now are being written inside a program called notepad++.
Right as I'm done typing this sentence I'm going to save this file as `index.html` and then I'm going to drag and drop this file into my web browser.
Yup, confirmed that it worked. (Which should be fairly obvious to you since you are reading these words in your web browser right now)

So what is this place?

Well...Hi. I'm Adrian. I'm the dude writing these words you are reading right now. Yup. that's me. (btw I'm glad that's the voice you chose for me)
Anyways, I've done some web developement in my career and spare time but I'm still really new to it.
In fact I wanted to get back into web dev and also had an itch to create my own website.
Currently my domain https://www.adrianmiasik.com re-directs to a third-party website with my game content on it.
But I've been meaning to create a proper place for my domain.
So I'll be creating a website that I can use for my portfolio work and also a site that I can document this journey on.

I want to create a visual timeline for the history of this site as I create it over time. I'm not sure how far I'll explore that idea but we'll see!
Check back soon!!!! In the meantime check out my website :^) https://www.adrianmiasik.com
