        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Well...Remember in one of my previous posts I showed you how each
          browser reacted differently to the same file? In that post I was only
          looking at what the browsers were displaying in the console. And as
          you probably guessed by now... I never took a close look at the
          visuals of the website. Turns out each browser might stylize certain
          HTML elements differently using their own defaults. This becomes an
          issue when we want our site to look the same on any browser.
          Fortunately, we can override the browsers defaults with our own style
          sheet! A lot of people use something called "CSS reset", but...
        </p>
        <br />
        <span>What is CSS reset?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          >A CSS reset is a custom CSS file that attempts to remove a lot of the
          browsers default styling's in order to achieve visual consistency

        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          >Well what if I don't want to remove the quotation marks from my
          quotes? You could just modify the style sheet and re-add the quotation

          So...</span

        <span>What is CSS normalize?</span>

        <span
          >CSS normalize is a custom CSS file that attempts to keep a lot the
          default margins and padding from browsers, but it will try to make the

        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          ><i
            >So wait I'm confused. What's the difference between CSS reset and
            CSS normalize?</i
          ></span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          The difference between CSS reset and CSS normalize, is that CSS reset
          aims to remove the default styling's where CSS normalize aims to keep
          the default styling's. Both of these solutions intend to minimize
          visual inconsistencies between browsers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <span>In fact, here's quite an informative video on the topic:</span>
        <br />
        <iframe

        <br />
        <span
          >Alright, so we now know the difference between CSS reset and CSS
          normalize. Let me show you how I added it to my site.</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          >First I created a new file inside my root directory called
          'reset.css'.</span
        >
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/root-project-directory-reset-css.png"
          alt="The root project directory with reset.css highlighted"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          >Then I added a variation of
          <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/">Eric Meyer's</a> CSS reset
          file.</span
        >
        <br />
        <p>This is what that looks like:</p>
        <img
          src="../images/reset-css-preview.png"
          alt="The contents of the CSS reset file."
        />
        <br />
        <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/"
          >You can find the original here.</a
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          >I then went into my index.html file, and added the following "code"
          into the bottom of my HTML head:</span
        >
        <br />
        <code> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="reset.css"/&gt;</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>So now my HTML head looks like this:</p>
        <img src="../images/html-head-add-reset-css.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          >And that's it! That all it takes to add custom CSS to index.html
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />

          Hey.
          <br />
          <br />
          So I wanted to put things in perspective.
          <br />
          What is this website currently made of?
          <br />
          To be honest...
          <br />
          Not much.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png"
          alt="The project directory of adrianmiasik.com"
          width="330"
          height="141"
        />
        <p>
          This is the entire project right now.
          <br />
          There isn't a lot here. Which is good! I can now quickly explain what
          this project currently consists of.
          <br />
        </p>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 141px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'

        <span
          >The purple folder icon labeled "adrianmiasik.com". We can refer to

        <br />
        <br />
        <span
          >Within our root directory there are 4 files and 1 folder. Let's start

        <div
          style='background-position-y: 121px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:

        <span
          >With whatever project you work on, you are going to want to try to

          With that purpose in mind, this folder will contain all our images we
          use on this site. Any photo/graphic file formats like (.jpg, .png,
          .svg, etc...) will live inside here. In fact, directory
          <code>root/images</code> currently has our first websites image called
          <code>this-image-you-are-looking-at.png</code>, which is the first
          image in this post.</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 81px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        Next up is <code>root/.gitignore</code>. I'm actually going to skip this
        once since it's related to version control and my choice of IDE. (I'll
        try to revisit this)
        <br />
        <br />
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 62px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        Next up is <code>root/index.html</code>. This is the website.
        <br />
        Everything you are seeing was made possible by this file.
        <br />
        The words you are reading right now are inside this file.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>So this file is pretty important...But how do you get it?</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        Well when you go to a website your web browser tells the server "Hey.
        I'd like to see this website: adrianmiasik.com"
        <br />
        The server then responses "Ah okay, you must be here for the homepage.
        Let me just run to the backroom and get you what you need".
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on how the server was configured it would typically look and
        return one of these files as a single entry point:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>index.htm</li>
          <li>index.html</li>
          <li>default.htm</li>
          <li>default.html</li>
          <li>home.htm</li>
          <li>home.html</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From reading online, it seems that we use all just use
          <strong>index.html</strong> now. Wish I could tell you why. But I
          don't know. I'm going to assume that's how most people configured
          their web servers and it sort of just stuck as the default.
        </p>
        <i>So what does <strong>index.html</strong> look like?</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        <a
          href="https://github.com/adrian-miasik/adrianmiasik.com/blob/master/index.html"
          >It looks like this.</a
        >
        Weird, right?
        <br />
        <p>
          It's just English with a bunch of "HTML Elements". I'm not going to go
          through them all...but each HTML element is used for a specific
          purpose. Sometimes that purpose is to make font bold. Sometimes that
          purpose is to define content. Sometimes that purpose is used to make
          links clickable. If you want to see a list of HTML elements, Mozilla
          has some good documentation here:
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"
            >HTML elements reference.</a
          >
          (Ayyy clickable link :^))
        </p>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 42px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <span>Next up is <code>LICENSE</code>.</span>
        <br />
        <span
          >This file is a legal document that governs the use and redistribution
          of this software. Pretty standard.</span

url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        Finally our last file is <code>README.md</code>
        <br />
        README files are typically used for documentation. It's a way for the
        creator to quickly convey useful information to others. The information
        can vary, for instance...some <i>read me</i> files are used as
        instructions to setup certain software configurations, installations,
        etc... Some use it as a manifest. Some use it for licensing and
        copyright. Some use it to credit the contributors. Some use it as a
        changelog. Some use it to display major known bugs. The truth is, this
        file is used for many things and it's generally worth the read.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span><i>What are you going to be using it for?</i></span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Who knows. Right now mine just contains this:</span>

        <br />
        <span>
          So just a large heading that you can click to get to my website. A
          fancy markdown badge related to hosting. And a brief description of
          this website.
        </span>
        <p>
          But that's the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your browser should've only received two files at the time of writing
          this. It should have received this <strong>index.html</strong> file.
          And this image:
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png"
          alt="The project directory of adrianmiasik.com"
        />
        <p>
          <i
            >But I see more than one image in this post. How did you do that?</i
          >
        </p>
        So that was all using the same single image inside
        <code>root/images</code>. Just with some inline CSS I was able to
        stylize an empty element (a div), give it a background image, offset the
        background image, and finally change the size. Essentially making
        multiple "cropped copies" from one image source.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can actually view this yourself. Right click this page and click
        <strong>'View Page Source'</strong>. Once you can see index.html in your
        browser...Look for the 'style' attribute on the div HTML elements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Speaking of which. Man. Is there a lot of content in a single document.
        I should probably start organizing these into separate pages. It's
        getting difficult to navigate up and down this page. heh.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
        <br />
        <span>Our site doesn't have a lot. It's got...</span>

        </ul>
        <p>
          There's a lot of "<i>I want</i>"s in there. Today I won't be covering
          any of that just yet. Instead I wanted to do another "browser status
          report" to see how browsers parses this site after
          <span style="color: gray">&#129460; The Bones Update &#129460;</span>
          and try to solve and obvious browser errors we see. And I also need to
          address a mistake I've made in my 2nd post. (Post #4 and we are
          already addressing a mistake?) Let's get into it!
          <br />
          <br />
          First up is Firefox.
          <br />
          So last time Firefox gave us this error:
        </p>
        <blockquote style="color: red">
          The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The
          document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations
          if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range.
          The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or
          in the transfer protocol.
        </blockquote>
        <span>And this time Firefox is giving us this error:</span>
        <blockquote style="color: red">
          The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The
          document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations
          if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range.
          The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or
          in the transfer protocol.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          So what gives? We are getting the same error. You said defining the
          DOCTYPE by placing <code> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </code> at the top of
          the html file will resolve this error.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Nope. I was wrong.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span
            >I realized that defining the document type is not the same as
            defining the character encoding.</span
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          <span
            >Also I realized I never explained what defining the document type
            was...So here goes!</span
          >
          <br />
          <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> solves the document type warnings
          and lets the browser know that it will be reading this as an HTML
          document. Defining the document type is often referred to as
          <i>DTD declaration</i>. (Document Type Definition). So why do we have
          to do this DTD declaration? Well, believe it or not but there are
          different types of HTML. And most browsers don't know which one you
          are using. The browser will actually try to "doctype sniff" and guess
          the document type you are using if one is not provided. But since
          programmers love being explicit, just define it. Just remember that
          there is one declaration that almost everyone uses,
          <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
          . Everything else is pretty much just a legacy thing.
          <br />
          <br />
          But how do we define the character encoding? And what is character
          encoding?
          <br />
          <br />
          Great questions. I did a bunch of research on this since I was curious
          about this too. In fact, I'll be sharing my findings in another post.
          <br />
          But for the scope of this post, I'm not going to go into that rabbit
          hole right now. If you are interested in hearing a brief explanation
          of character encoding, ASCII, Unicode, and UTF-8.
          <a href="https://github.com/adrian-miasik/adrianmiasik.com/releases">
            Make sure to watch my GitHub releases page.
          </a>
          ;)
          <br />
          <br />
          Okay sure, I'll ignore what character encoding is for now. How do I
          solve this character encoding error?
          <br />
          <br />
          There are actually many solutions to this answer. But...for a lot of
          modern web pages you are probably going to resort to character
          encoding UTF-8. (especially for western characters)
          <br />
          For now we can solve this error by adding this to be the first HTML
          element inside our head: <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; </code>
          <br />
          <br />
          Second up is Google Chrome.
          <br />
          Works just fine!
          <br />
          <br />
          Next up is Internet Explorer 11.
          <br />
          Loads fine. However I did realize, the emotes in my previous post
          title "The Bones Update" are not being displayed properly. Instead of
          bones, there are blue hollow boxes. And the emotes within the post
          look different and only have a black and white color scheme.
          Interesting observation. Besides that, everything looks fine.
          <br />
          <br />
          Last up is Microsoft Edge.
          <br />
          Microsoft Edge, renders everything just fine. However we do have 6
          console messages. (1 info, 5 warnings) Let's go through them:
          <br />
          <br />
          <code> HTML1300: Navigation occurred.</code>
          <br />
          This is that same simple information log, I'm going to ignore this
          again.
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>
            HTML1402: Character reference is missing an ending semicolon
            ";".</code
          >
          <br />
          This is the warning that gets printed 5 times. Apparently I've been
          creating emoji's in HTML incorrectly. For instance I've originally
          created the eyes emoji by typing in
          <span style="color: red">& # 1 2 9 4 6 0</span> in HTML. (with no
          spaces) After a quick google search of the error it seems any special
          character in HTML must end in a semicolon.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alright, that's all 4 browsers I'll be using for this browser report.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Looks like we now have our action items:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code> to the first thing in
            our HTML head
          </li>
          <li>Add a semicolon for any special character in HTML</li>
        </ul>
        See you in the next update!

        <p>
          I noticed something in the previous post. I've tested this file on
          numerous web browsers and each one reacts slightly differently. Let me
          show you.
          <br />
          <br />
          First up is
          <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> .
          <br />
          This file (`index.html`) works on Firefox. But I noticed that the
          console did spit out an error:
          <br />
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The
          document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations
          if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range.
          The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or
          in the transfer protocol.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Alright that should be pretty easy to address. I've used
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to learn web dev
          before, so I do remember that each website needs to adhere to a
          certain HTML structure. The first HTML element in any document should
          be...:<!DOCTYPE html>
          <br />
          <br />
          Hmm, interesting. You didn't see it but adding `!DOCTYPE html`
          (Replace the ` with <> respectively) doesn't appear in my versions of
          Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, and also Microsoft Edge. So
          even just typing out the correct DOCTYPE element in an HTML file is
          not enough, it does seems to get deleted by the 4 aforementioned
          browsers. Good to know. Anyways, I digress.
          <br />
          <br />
          Second up is
          <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> .
          <br />
          This file works in Chrome. The console spits out no errors or warnings
          and accepts this page as is. Great!
          <br />
          <br />
          Third up is
          <a
            href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads"
            >Internet Explorer 11</a
          >.
          <br />
          This file works in Internet Explorer 11. The console spits out no
          errors or warnings and accepts this page as is. Also great!
          <br />
          <br />
          Last up is
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge"
            >Microsoft Edge</a
          >.
          <br />
          This file works in Microsoft Edge but we do get certain console logs.
          Let's go all 4 of them:
          <br />
          <br />
          <code> HTML1300: Navigation occurred.</code>
          <br />
          This is a simple information log, I'm going to ignore this one for
          now.
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>
            HTML1527: DOCTYPE expected. Consider adding a valid HTML5 doctype:
            "<!DOCTYPE html>".</code
          >
          <br />
          Funny enough, this warning gets removed just like in my Firefox
          comment before.
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>
            HTML1502: Unexpected DOCTYPE. Only one DOCTYPE is allowed and it
            must occur before any elements.</code
          >
          <br />
          Okay similar error that I will fix in the next post.
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>
            HTML1407: Invalid tag name. First character should match
            [a-zA-Z].</code
          >
          <br />
          Okay right so it's complaining about `-` being the first character in
          this file. We are replacing the first line with the DOCTYPE so we
          should first apply that solution and see how Microsoft Edge reacts.
          Funny enough, the copy paste of error 3/4 above is now showing 2
          HTML1502 logs on this page.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alright so what have we noticed? Out of my sample size of 4 browsers,
          all of them were able to view this file just fine. In fact all four
          browsers auto-generated a proper HTML structure while putting all the
          text you are reading into one paragraph element. Neat-o! Firefox was
          able to tell us our file was incorrect and how it could be incorrect
          in some browsers. Which is really great to see actually! Microsoft
          Edge was expecting a DOCTYPE but didn't tell us why nor how. It did
          however provide us a solution to fix it though. Google Chrome and
          Internet Explorer 11 had no problems with our files. Now I'm not sure
          if that concerns me or not. Haha.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
          <br />
          So, what's the takeaway from all this? Welp, this tells us that most
          browsers are not the same. For better or for worse each browser will
          most likely parse each website slightly differently. (I'm not going to
          get to far into that, but this does become a headache later on)
          <br />
          My next steps are clear. Let's structure this file using HTML. See you
          in the next update!
