        <span>So this site just got a bit uglier. (I mean it's already pretty ugly to begin with. lol)</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Notice the titles for each of the blog posts? They're all the same size now.</span>
        <br />
        <span>Notice the spacing for a lot of our content? It's all gone.</span>
        <br />
        <span>Notice our block quotes? The indentation and quotation marks have also been removed.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span><i>So what gives Adrian? What did you do?</i></span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Well...Remember in one of my previous posts I showed you how each browser reacted differently to the same
          file? In that post I was only looking at what the browsers were displaying in the console. And as you probably
          guessed by now... I never took a close look at the visuals of the website. Turns out each browser might
          stylize certain HTML elements differently using their own defaults. This becomes an issue when we want our
          site to look the same on any browser. Fortunately, we can override the browsers defaults with our own style
          sheet! A lot of people use something called "CSS reset", but...
        </p>
        <br />
        <span>What is CSS reset?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          A CSS reset is a custom CSS file that attempts to remove a lot of the browsers default styling's in order to
          achieve visual consistency between browsers.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Well what if I don't want to remove the quotation marks from my quotes? You could just modify the style sheet
          and re-add the quotation marks back in. But then I can't tell you about CSS normalize. So...
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>What is CSS normalize?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          CSS normalize is a custom CSS file that attempts to keep a lot the default margins and padding from browsers,
          but it will try to make the default styling's consistent between browsers.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span><i>So wait I'm confused. What's the difference between CSS reset and CSS normalize?</i></span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          The difference between CSS reset and CSS normalize, is that CSS reset aims to remove the default styling's
          where CSS normalize aims to keep the default styling's. Both of these solutions intend to minimize visual
          inconsistencies between browsers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <span>In fact, here's quite an informative video on the topic:</span>
        <br />
        <iframe
          width="560"
          height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9AO5H6B3tZo"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <br />
        <span>If you were curious, I'm currently using CSS reset for this site.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Alright, so we now know the difference between CSS reset and CSS normalize. Let me show you how I added it to
          my site.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>First I created a new file inside my root directory called 'reset.css'.</span>
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/root-project-directory-reset-css.png"
          alt="The root project directory with reset.css highlighted"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Then I added a variation of
          <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/">Eric Meyer's</a>
          CSS reset file.
        </span>
        <br />
        <p>This is what that looks like:</p>
        <img src="../images/reset-css-preview.png" alt="The contents of the CSS reset file." />
        <br />
        <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">You can find the original here.</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          I then went into my index.html file, and added the following "code" into the bottom of my HTML head:
        </span>
        <br />
        <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="reset.css"/&gt;</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>So now my HTML head looks like this:</p>
        <img src="../images/html-head-add-reset-css.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>And that's it! That all it takes to add custom CSS to index.html</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Watch my
          <a href="https://github.com/adrian-miasik/adrianmiasik.com/releases">GitHub releases page</a>
          to get notified of any new content I add to this site. I'll try to look into a better way of notifying you
          guys on any new content I add. Maybe an email listing or something? But in the meantime use my GitHub releases
          page.
        </p>
        <br />
        <span>Thanks for reading! :)</span>

        <h3>Publication Date: 2019-11-07 (11:39 p.m. EST)</h3>
        <p>
          Hey.
          <br />
          <br />
          So I wanted to put things in perspective.
          <br />
          What is this website currently made of?
          <br />
          To be honest...
          <br />
          Not much.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png"
          alt="The project directory of adrianmiasik.com"
          width="330"
          height="141"
        />
        <p>
          This is the entire project right now.
          <br />
          There isn't a lot here. Which is good! I can now quickly explain what this project currently consists of.
          <br />
        </p>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 141px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <span>
          The purple folder icon labeled "adrianmiasik.com". We can refer to this folder as our
          <code>root</code>
          directory. Our entire project will likely live inside this directory.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Within our root directory there are 4 files and 1 folder. Let's start at the folder at path:
          <code>root/images</code>
          .
        </span>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 121px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <span>
          With whatever project you work on, you are going to want to try to keep things neat and tidy so you know where
          everything is located. With that purpose in mind, this folder will contain all our images we use on this site.
          Any photo/graphic file formats like (.jpg, .png, .svg, etc...) will live inside here. In fact, directory
          <code>root/images</code>
          currently has our first websites image called
          <code>this-image-you-are-looking-at.png</code>
          , which is the first image in this post.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 81px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        Next up is
        <code>root/.gitignore</code>
        . I'm actually going to skip this once since it's related to version control and my choice of IDE. (I'll try to
        revisit this)
        <br />
        <br />
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 62px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        Next up is
        <code>root/index.html</code>
        . This is the website.
        <br />
        Everything you are seeing was made possible by this file.
        <br />
        The words you are reading right now are inside this file.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>So this file is pretty important...But how do you get it?</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        Well when you go to a website your web browser tells the server "Hey. I'd like to see this website:
        adrianmiasik.com"
        <br />
        The server then responses "Ah okay, you must be here for the homepage. Let me just run to the backroom and get
        you what you need".
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on how the server was configured it would typically look and return one of these files as a single
        entry point:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>index.htm</li>
          <li>index.html</li>
          <li>default.htm</li>
          <li>default.html</li>
          <li>home.htm</li>
          <li>home.html</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From reading online, it seems that we use all just use
          <strong>index.html</strong>
          now. Wish I could tell you why. But I don't know. I'm going to assume that's how most people configured their
          web servers and it sort of just stuck as the default.
        </p>
        <i>
          So what does
          <strong>index.html</strong>
          look like?
        </i>
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://github.com/adrian-miasik/adrianmiasik.com/blob/master/index.html">It looks like this.</a>
        Weird, right?
        <br />
        <p>
          It's just English with a bunch of "HTML Elements". I'm not going to go through them all...but each HTML
          element is used for a specific purpose. Sometimes that purpose is to make font bold. Sometimes that purpose is
          to define content. Sometimes that purpose is used to make links clickable. If you want to see a list of HTML
          elements, Mozilla has some good documentation here:
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">HTML elements reference.</a>
          (Ayyy clickable link :^))
        </p>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 42px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <span>
          Next up is
          <code>LICENSE</code>
          .
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>
          This file is a legal document that governs the use and redistribution of this software. Pretty standard.

        ></div>
        Finally our last file is
        <code>README.md</code>
        <br />
        README files are typically used for documentation. It's a way for the creator to quickly convey useful
        information to others. The information can vary, for instance...some
        <i>read me</i>
        files are used as instructions to setup certain software configurations, installations, etc... Some use it as a
        manifest. Some use it for licensing and copyright. Some use it to credit the contributors. Some use it as a
        changelog. Some use it to display major known bugs. The truth is, this file is used for many things and it's
        generally worth the read.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span><i>What are you going to be using it for?</i></span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Who knows. Right now mine just contains this:</span>

        <br />
        <span>
          So just a large heading that you can click to get to my website. A fancy markdown badge related to hosting.
          And a brief description of this website.
        </span>
        <p>
          But that's the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your browser should've only received two files at the time of writing this. It should have received this
          <strong>index.html</strong>
          file. And this image:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png" alt="The project directory of adrianmiasik.com" />
        <p>
          <i>But I see more than one image in this post. How did you do that?</i>
        </p>
        So that was all using the same single image inside
        <code>root/images</code>
        . Just with some inline CSS I was able to stylize an empty element (a div), give it a background image, offset
        the background image, and finally change the size. Essentially making multiple "cropped copies" from one image
        source.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can actually view this yourself. Right click this page and click
        <strong>'View Page Source'</strong>
        . Once you can see index.html in your browser...Look for the 'style' attribute on the div HTML elements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Speaking of which. Man. Is there a lot of content in a single document. I should probably start organizing these
        into separate pages. It's getting difficult to navigate up and down this page. heh.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
        <br />
        <span>Our site doesn't have a lot. It's got...</span>
        <ul>
          <li><code>root/images/</code></li>
          This folder will contain all our images. (Currently it contains one image)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>root/images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png</code></li>
          This image file is our first hosted image on adrianmiasik.com
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>root/.gitignore</code></li>
          This is a file that prevents certain directories/files from being included in our version control.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>root/index.html</code></li>
          This file contains most of what you are currently viewing. This is the bones and content of adrianmiasik.com
          &#127930;
        </ul>
