        <p>
          Hey.
          <br />
          <br />
          So I wanted to put things in perspective.
          <br />
          What is this website currently made of?
          <br />
          To be honest...
          <br />
          Not much. Take a look at our site:
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png"
          alt="The project directory of adrianmiasik.com"
          width="330"
          height="141"
        />
        <p>
          This is the entire project right now. It's just 5 files. (Most of this site lives in index.html, more on this
          later)
          <br />
          There isn't a lot here. Which is good! I can quickly explain what you are looking at.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 141px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <span>
          The purple folder named "adrianmiasik.com" is where our site lives. We can refer to this folder as our
          <code>root</code>
          directory. Our entire project will likely live inside this directory.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Within our
          <em>root</em>
          directory there are 4 files and 1 folder. Let's start at the folder at path:
          <code>root/images</code>
          .
        </span>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 121px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <span>
          With whatever project you work on, you are going to want to try to keep things neat and tidy so you know where
          everything is located. With that purpose in mind, this folder will contain all our images we use on this site.
          Any photo/graphic file formats like (.jpg, .png, .svg, etc...) will live inside here. In fact, directory
          <code>root/images</code>
          currently has our first websites image called
          <code>this-image-you-are-looking-at.png</code>
          , which is the first image in this article. (The smaller images are just cropped copies of the one image, more
          on this later too)
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 81px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <p>
          Next up is
          <code>root/.gitignore</code>
          . I'm actually going to skip this once since it's related to version control and my choice of IDE. (I'll try
          to revisit this)
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 62px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <p>
          Next up is
          <code>root/index.html</code>
          . This is the website.
          <br />
          Everything you are seeing was made possible by this file.
          <br />
          The words you are reading right now are inside this file.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>So this file is pretty important...But how do you get it?</i>
          <br />
          <br />
          Well when you go to a website your web browser tells the server "Hey. I'd like to see this website:
          adrianmiasik.com"
          <br />
          The server then responses "Ah okay, you must be here for the homepage. Let me just run to the backroom and get
          you what you need".
          <br />
          <br />
          Depending on how the server was configured it would typically look and return one of these files as a single
          entry point:
          <br />
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>index.htm</li>
          <li>index.html</li>
          <li>default.htm</li>
          <li>default.html</li>
          <li>home.htm</li>
          <li>home.html</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From reading online, it seems that we use all just use
          <strong>index.html</strong>
          now. Wish I could tell you why. But I don't know. I'm going to assume that's how most people configured their
          web servers and it sort of just stuck as the default.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what does
          <strong>index.html</strong>
          look like?
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/adrian-miasik/adrianmiasik.com/blob/master/index.html">It looks like this.</a>
          Weird, right?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It's just English with a bunch of "HTML Elements". I'm not going to go through them all...but each HTML
          element is used for a specific purpose. Sometimes that purpose is to make font bold. Sometimes that purpose is
          to define content. Sometimes that purpose is used to make links clickable. If you want to see a list of HTML
          elements, Mozilla has some good documentation
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">here.</a>
        </p>
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 42px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <span>
          Next up is
          <code>LICENSE</code>
          .
        </span>
        <br />
        <p>
          This file is a legal document that governs the use and redistribution of this software. Pretty standard.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div
          style='background-position-y: 22px; height: 20px; width: 330px; background-image:
url("../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png");'
        ></div>
        <p>
          Finally our last file is
          <code>README.md</code>
          <br />
          README files are typically used for documentation. It's a way for the creator to quickly convey useful
          information to others. The information can vary, for instance...some
          <i>read me</i>
          files are used as instructions to setup certain software configurations, installations, etc... Some use it as
          a manifest. Some use it for licensing and copyright. Some use it to credit the contributors. Some use it as a
          changelog. Some use it to display major known bugs. The truth is, this file is used for many things and it's
          generally worth the read.

        <p>
          So just a large heading that you can click to get to my website. A fancy markdown badge related to my hosting.
          And a brief description of this website.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But that's the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your browser should've only received two files at the time of writing this. You should have received the
          <code>index.html</code>
          file. And this image:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png" alt="The project directory of adrianmiasik.com" />
        <p>
          <em>I see more than one image in this post. How did you do that?</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So that was all using the same single image inside
          <code>root/images</code>
          . Just with some inline CSS I was able to stylize an empty element (a div), give it a background image, offset
          the background image, and finally change the size. Essentially making multiple "cropped copies" from one image
          source.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can actually view this yourself. Right click this page and click
          <strong>'View Page Source'</strong>
          . Once you can see index.html in your browser...Look for the 'style' attribute on the div HTML elements.
          <br />
          <br />
          Speaking of which. Man. Is there a lot of content in a single document. I should probably start organizing
          these into separate pages. It's getting difficult to navigate up and down this page. heh.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
          <br />
          <span>Our site doesn't have a lot. It's got...</span>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>root/images/</code></li>
          This folder will contain all our images. (Currently it contains one image)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>root/images/this-image-you-are-looking-at.png</code></li>
          This image file is our first hosted image on adrianmiasik.com
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>root/.gitignore</code></li>
          This is a file that prevents certain directories/files from being included in our version control.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>root/index.html</code></li>
          This file contains most of what you are currently viewing. This is the bones and content of adrianmiasik.com
