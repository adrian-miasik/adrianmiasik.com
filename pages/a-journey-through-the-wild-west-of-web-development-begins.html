        Alright Chris. I finally made that website I was talking about. It's not
        much, but it's a start :)
        <br />
        <br />
        In fact I'm not even sure this will properly work on most web browsers.
        There isn't any proper meta data or html tags here. But that's the
        beauty of this. I get to find out and learn as I go!
        <br />
        So these words you are reading right now are being written inside a
        program called notepad++. Right as I'm done typing this sentence I'm
        going to save this file as `index.html` and then I'm going to drag and
        drop this file into my web browser. Yup, confirmed that it worked.
        (Which should be fairly obvious to you since you are reading these words
        in your web browser right now)
        <br />
        So what is this place?
        <br />
        <br />
        Well...Hi. I'm Adrian. I'm the dude writing these words you are reading
        right now. Yup. that's me. (btw I'm glad that's the voice you chose for
        me) Anyways, I've done some web development in my career and spare time
        but I'm still really new to it. In fact I wanted to get back into web
        dev and also had an itch to create my own website. Currently my domain
        <a href="https://www.adrianmiasik.com">https://www.adrianmiasik.com</a>
        re-directs to
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"
          >a third-party website with my game content on it.</span
        >
        the most recent version of this website! I've been meaning to create a
        proper place for my domain. So I'll be creating a website that I can use
        for my portfolio work and also a site that I can document this journey
        on.
        <br />
        I want to create a visual timeline for the history of this site as I
        create it over time. I'm not sure how far I'll explore that idea but
        we'll see!
        <br />
        <br />
        Check back soon!!!! In the meantime check out my website :^)
