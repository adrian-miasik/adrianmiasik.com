          I noticed something in the previous post. I've tested this file on numerous web browsers and each one reacts
          slightly differently. Let me show you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <section class="browser-border">
          <p>
            First up is
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>
          </p>
          <span>
            This file
          </span>
          <code>index.html</code>
          <span>works on Firefox. But I noticed that the console did spit out an error:</span>
          <blockquote>
            The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in
            some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The
            character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Alright that should be pretty easy to address. I've used
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>
            to learn web dev before, so I do remember that each website needs to adhere to a certain HTML structure. The
            first HTML element in any document should be
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
          </p>
        </section>
        <br />

        <section class="browser-border">
          <span>Second up is</span>
          <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>
          <p>
            This file works in Chrome. The console spits out no errors or warnings and accepts this page as is. Great!
          </p>
        </section>
        <br />

        <section class="browser-border">
          <span>Third up is</span>
          <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads">Internet Explorer 11</a>
          <p>
            This file works in Internet Explorer 11. The console spits out no errors or warnings and accepts this page
            as is. Also great!
          </p>
        </section>
        <br />

        <section class="browser-border">
          <span>Last up is</span>
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge">Microsoft Edge</a>
          <p>
            This file works in Microsoft Edge but we do get certain console logs.
            <br />
            Let's take a look at them:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            HTML1300: Navigation occurred.
            <br />
            HTML1527: DOCTYPE expected. Consider adding a valid HTML5 doctype: " ".
            <br />
            HTML1502: Unexpected DOCTYPE. Only one DOCTYPE is allowed and it must occur before any elements.
            <br />
            HTML1407: Invalid tag name. First character should match [a-zA-Z].
          </blockquote>
          <br />
          <p>Let's go through them all individually:</p>
          <br />
          <span>
            <code>HTML1300: Navigation occurred.</code>
            <br />
            This is a simple information log, I'm going to ignore this one.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />

          <span>
            <code>
              HTML1527: DOCTYPE expected. Consider adding a valid HTML5 doctype: "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;".
            </code>
            <br />
            This warning gets removed after we add
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
            to the top of our HTML page .
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />

          <span>
            <code>
              HTML1502: Unexpected DOCTYPE. Only one DOCTYPE is allowed and it must occur before any elements.
            </code>
            <br />
            This warning gets removed after we add
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
            to the top of our HTML page .
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />

          <span>
            <code>
              HTML1407: Invalid tag name. First character should match [a-zA-Z].
            </code>
            <br />
            This is complaining about
            <code>-</code>
            being the first character in this file. We are replacing the first line with the
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
            so we should first apply that solution and see how Microsoft Edge reacts.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />

          <p>
            Alright so what have we noticed? Out of my sample size of 4 browsers, all of them were able to view this
            file just fine. In fact all four browsers auto-generated a proper HTML structure while putting all the text
            you are reading into one paragraph element. Neat-o! Firefox was able to tell us our file was incorrect and
            how it could be incorrect in some browsers. Which is really great to see actually! Microsoft Edge was
            expecting a DOCTYPE but didn't tell us why nor how. It did however provide us a solution to fix it though.
            Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 11 had no problems with our files. Now I'm not sure if that concerns me
            or not. Haha.
          </p>

        <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          So, what's the takeaway from all this? Welp, this tells us that most browsers are not the same. For better or
          for worse each browser will most likely parse each website slightly differently. (I'm not going to get to far
          into that, but this does become a headache later on)
          <br />
          <br />
          My next steps are clear. Let's structure this file using HTML. See you soon!
