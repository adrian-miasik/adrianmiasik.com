        I noticed something in the previous post. I've tested this file on numerous web browsers and each one reacts
        slightly differently. Let me show you.
        <br />
        <br />
        First up is
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>
        .
        <br />
        This file (`index.html`) works on Firefox. But I noticed that the console did spit out an error:
        <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some
        browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character
        encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Alright that should be pretty easy to address. I've used
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>
        to learn web dev before, so I do remember that each website needs to adhere to a certain HTML structure. The
        first HTML element in any document should be...:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <br />
        <br />
        Hmm, interesting. You didn't see it but adding `!DOCTYPE html` (Replace the ` with <> respectively) doesn't
        appear in my versions of Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, and also Microsoft Edge. So even just typing out
        the correct DOCTYPE element in an HTML file is not enough, it does seems to get deleted by the 4 aforementioned
        browsers. Good to know. Anyways, I digress.
        <br />
        <br />
        Second up is
        <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>
        .
        <br />
        This file works in Chrome. The console spits out no errors or warnings and accepts this page as is. Great!
        <br />
        <br />
        Third up is
        <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads">Internet Explorer 11</a>
        .
        <br />
        This file works in Internet Explorer 11. The console spits out no errors or warnings and accepts this page as
        is. Also great!
        <br />
        <br />
        Last up is
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge">Microsoft Edge</a>
        .
        <br />
        This file works in Microsoft Edge but we do get certain console logs. Let's go all 4 of them:
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>HTML1300: Navigation occurred.</code>
        <br />
        This is a simple information log, I'm going to ignore this one for now.
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>
          HTML1527: DOCTYPE expected. Consider adding a valid HTML5 doctype: "
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          ".
        </code>
        <br />
        Funny enough, this warning gets removed just like in my Firefox comment before.
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>HTML1502: Unexpected DOCTYPE. Only one DOCTYPE is allowed and it must occur before any elements.</code>
        <br />
        Okay similar error that I will fix in the next post.
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>HTML1407: Invalid tag name. First character should match [a-zA-Z].</code>
        <br />
        Okay right so it's complaining about `-` being the first character in this file. We are replacing the first line
        with the DOCTYPE so we should first apply that solution and see how Microsoft Edge reacts. Funny enough, the
        copy paste of error 3/4 above is now showing 2 HTML1502 logs on this page.
        <br />
        <br />
        Alright so what have we noticed? Out of my sample size of 4 browsers, all of them were able to view this file
        just fine. In fact all four browsers auto-generated a proper HTML structure while putting all the text you are
        reading into one paragraph element. Neat-o! Firefox was able to tell us our file was incorrect and how it could
        be incorrect in some browsers. Which is really great to see actually! Microsoft Edge was expecting a DOCTYPE but
        didn't tell us why nor how. It did however provide us a solution to fix it though. Google Chrome and Internet
        Explorer 11 had no problems with our files. Now I'm not sure if that concerns me or not. Haha.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
        <br />
        So, what's the takeaway from all this? Welp, this tells us that most browsers are not the same. For better or
        for worse each browser will most likely parse each website slightly differently. (I'm not going to get to far
        into that, but this does become a headache later on)
        <br />
        My next steps are clear. Let's structure this file using HTML. See you in the next update!
